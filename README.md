### Hi there üëã

I am an independent consultant/contractor specialising in Java & Spring & AWS with a passion for software development and open source.

I am (very) active on twitter and share learnings on my blog & youtube channel:

My main area of focus is:

## [Spring Cloud AWS](https://github.com/awspring/spring-cloud-aws)

**Spring Cloud AWS** simplifies using AWS managed services in **Spring Boot** application.

In May 2020 took the lead of Spring Cloud AWS, fixed dozens of bugs, implemented handful of improvements, kept project alive and sparked again the community interest.

We are working on version 3.0 of the project - complete rewrite based on AWS SDK 2.0. We have already spent hundreds of hours and will spend much more.

## [Just](https://just.maciejwalkowiak.com/)

**Just** is a command Line toolkit for developing **Spring Boot** applications. It **significantly speeds up the development** through advanced **live reload** capabilities and automatically provisioned infrastructure like databases or message queues

## [WireMock Spring Boot](https://github.com/maciejwalkowiak/wiremock-spring-boot/)

WireMock Spring Boot drastically simplifies testing HTTP clients in Spring Boot & Junit 5 based integration tests.

## Others

I also made few OSS projects I find really cool:

- [paseq-maven-plugin](https://github.com/maciejwalkowiak/paseq-maven-plugin) - Maven Plugin for running Maven goals and commands sequentially or in parallel
- [sinit](https://github.com/maciejwalkowiak/sinit) - command line shiny Spring Boot project initialzer
- [yolo](https://github.com/maciejwalkowiak/yolo) - because life's too short for running tests
